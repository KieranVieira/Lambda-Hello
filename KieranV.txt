Hello my name is Kieran.

Three personality trait words that describe me are commited, passionate, and caring.

My favorite hobby is a tie between gaming and coding. I really enjoy anything to do with 
computers and have been using them for the majority of my life. I started just using them
to create graphic desgins and slowly moved into a more professional hobby.
